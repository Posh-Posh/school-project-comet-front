# projet-LaComete

This is the front part of a school project done in 3 weeks, coded with ReactJS and ES6. I used a base model set up by our teacher.
It was a group project where we had to create a website based on an idea I had about an ads platform where people can either submit their ideas or a profile and get together to make projects come true. This is only the front part as it's the one I wrote.
